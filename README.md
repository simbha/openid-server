Q&D OpenID Server
=================

This is a quickly hacked OpenID server, which runs at
https://hugo.osvaldobarrera.com.ar.

Anyone wanting a quick OpenID server too lazy to code no can reuse
this, with a few minor tweaks. (Mainly, change the password, base
URL, and some texts on the templates).

I've considered making this more customizable in future,
but don't count on it. It took me about 2 years to just sit down a
few hours to unuglify it.
The code is also horrible, though it might still serve as a reference.
I think that if I ever get to refactor it, I might use some other
HTTP Server library.

Feel free to send pull requests with improvements! :D
